# gradle-layout-plugin Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
High-quality, maintainable, and easy-to-understand code is required. All code must adhere to established coding standards, be well-documented, and include clear, concise comments where logic is complex.

### II. Testing Standards
A comprehensive testing strategy is non-negotiable. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests where appropriate. High test coverage is expected, and all new features or bug fixes must be accompanied by relevant tests.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and predictable user experience is paramount. Interfaces, APIs, and command-line interactions must follow established patterns and be intuitive for the user.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Software must be designed and implemented to be efficient and responsive. Performance metrics should be established for critical operations, and code must be optimized to meet these targets without sacrificing clarity or maintainability.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
